## Project Abstract
This project explores the quality of Calgary's water bodies through the analysis of pH patterns, focusing on their overall health and stability. pH serves as a critical indicator of water quality, impacting aquatic ecosystems and human use. The study examines key patterns across various water sources, including rivers, lakes, and streams, to provide actionable insights into environmental and public health.

The analysis was conducted using **R** and employed libraries such as **ggplot2**, **dplyr**, **stats**, and **lubridate**. Key methodologies included data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and simple linear regression. The project revealed minimal seasonal effects on pH levels, but relationships with dissolved oxygen and turbidity were significant.

## Repository Description
This repository contains:
+ `water_pH_analysis.Rmd` - R Markdown file detailing the full analysis process, from data cleaning to regression modelling.
+ `water_quality_data.csv` - Dataset containing pH measurements and other water quality parameters from Calgary's water bodies.
+ `visualizations/` - Directory containing plots and graphs illustrating pH trends and relationships.
+ `water_quality_analysis.pdf` - Final report summarizing the study and its findings.

## Acknowledgments
This project was completed as part of the MDSA program by a team of four students in the Master in Data Science and Analytics program at the University of Calgary. The dataset and resources were provided by the City of Calgary's open data portal. Special thanks to our instructor for his guidance and support throughout the project.
